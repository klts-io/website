weight: -20200008559
short_description: |
    This is a security vulnerability of the `kube-apiserver` component. An attacker can intercept certain upgrade requests sent to the node `kubelet`, and forward the request to other target nodes through the original access credentials in the request that could allow an attacker to escalate privileges from a node compromise to a full cluster compromise.

This is a security vulnerability of the `kube-apiserver` component. An attacker can intercept certain upgrade requests sent to the node `kubelet`, and forward the request to other target nodes through the original access credentials in the request that could allow an attacker to escalate privileges from a node compromise to a full cluster compromise. 

## Scope {#scope}

Since `kube-apiserver` allows the request to be propagated back to the source client in the proxied upgrade request, the attacker can intercept certain upgrade requests sent to the node `kubelet`, and then use the original access credentials in the request to forward requests to other target nodes, resulting in a privilege escalation vulnerability on the attacked node.

### CVSS scores {#cvss}

This vulnerability is rated as medium-risk with a `CVSS` score of 6.4. If multiple clusters share the same `CA` and authentication credentials, an attacker can use this vulnerability to attack other clusters. In this case, it is a high-risk vulnerability.

## Prevention {#prevention}

For cross-node attacks in the cluster, it is recommended that you take the following preventative measures:
- Timely revoke `kubeconfig` credentials that may cause leakage potentially, and follow the least principle of minimum permissions to converge unnecessary `pods/exec`, `pods/attach`, `pods/portforward` and `proxy` resource models with the `RBAC` permission.
