This is a volume security issue related to permission access. A user can access files and directories outside the volume mounting directory, including the host's file system, through the volume mounting method of `subpath` in the created container.

## Scope {#scope}

This vulnerability affects related behaviors of `kubelet`, and the issue is particularly serious for cluster administrators who may strictly restrict the creation of `hostPath`.

### CVSS scores {#cvss}

This vulnerability is rated as medium-risk with a `CVSS` score of 5.5.

## Prevention {#prevention}

For users who do not want to upgrade kubelet, they can use two preventative measures:
- Disable `VolumeSubpath` for `kubelet` and `kube-apiserver` and remove all `pods` that are using this feature.
- Use `admission control` to prevent users with low trust levels from running the container with the `root` permission.
