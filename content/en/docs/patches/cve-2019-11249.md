This vulnerability may allow an attacker to use the `kubectl cp` command to write malicious files in the container `tar` package to any path on the host using Path Traversal. This process is limited only by the system permissions of the local user.

## Scope {#scope}

This vulnerability has a similar impact caused by {{< link url="/docs/patches/cve-2019-1002101/" >}} and {{< link url="/docs/patches/cve-2019-11246/" >}} that were found not long before.  

The `kubectl cp` command allows copying files between containers and the user machine. To copy files from a container, `Kubernetes` runs `tar` inside the container to create a tar archive, copies it over the network, and `kubectl` unpacks it on the user’s machine.   

If the tar binary in the container is malicious, it could run any code and output unexpected, malicious results. An attacker could use this to write files to any path (Path Traversal) on the user’s machine when kubectl cp is called.
