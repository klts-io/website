Kubernetes being an enterprise infrastructure, you should not use a version of Kubernetes that is no longer maintained.
KLTS maintains the version that Kubernetes no longer maintains officially. You only need to upgrade to the KLTS patch
version with minor fixes.
To avoid bugs caused by upgrading your base to newer versions of Kubernetes, introducing features that are not currently
available,
Make Kubernetes more stable as your infrastructure.
